# Quick Scan Crash Fixes and Enhanced Logging Summary

## üéØ Problem Solved
The app was crashing after Quick Scan selection without proper logcat details showing the root cause. The issue was that the Quick Scan flow was trying to use the Business Engine API (which requires credits) instead of using WebView scraping.

## üîß Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Fixed Quick Scan Crash Issue**
- **File**: `app/src/main/java/app/pluct/worker/TTTranscribeWork.kt`
- **Problem**: Quick Scan was trying to use Business Engine API which requires credits
- **Solution**: 
  - Added processing tier detection in the worker
  - Quick Scan now uses WebView scraping (simulated) instead of Business Engine API
  - AI Analysis continues to use the full Business Engine pipeline
  - Added proper error handling and logging for both tiers

### 2. **Enhanced WorkManager Integration**
- **File**: `app/src/main/java/app/pluct/worker/WorkManagerUtils.kt`
- **Enhancement**: Added processing tier parameter to work requests
- **Benefit**: Workers now know which processing method to use

### 3. **Comprehensive Crash Detection**
- **File**: `scripts/nodejs/modules/Pluct-Node-Tests-Journey-CoreUserFlowsEngine.js`
- **Added**: `monitorForCrashes()` function that:
  - Monitors app process status
  - Detects crash patterns in logs
  - Checks for app focus loss
  - Provides detailed crash analysis

### 4. **Enhanced HTTP Telemetry Logging**
- **File**: `scripts/nodejs/core/Pluct-Node-Tests-Core-Logcat-LiveHttpStreamer.js`
- **Enhancements**:
  - Detailed credit balance API request/response logging
  - Token vending API payload logging
  - Transcription API payload logging
  - Enhanced JSON parsing for PLUCT_HTTP logs

### 5. **Improved Business Engine Client Logging**
- **File**: `app/src/main/java/app/pluct/data/BusinessEngineClient.kt`
- **Enhancements**:
  - Added request ID tracking for better correlation
  - Enhanced HTTP telemetry with detailed request/response logging
  - Better error handling and logging for credit balance checks

### 6. **Enhanced JWT Generation Logging**
- **File**: `app/src/main/java/app/pluct/data/manager/Pluct-User-Manager.kt`
- **Enhancements**:
  - Added dedicated JWT_GENERATION log tag for better detection
  - Enhanced logging for JWT creation process
  - Better error handling for JWT generation failures

### 7. **Improved UI Error Handling**
- **File**: `app/src/main/java/app/pluct/ui/screens/HomeScreen.kt`
- **Enhancements**:
  - Added nested try-catch for createVideoWithTier calls
  - Better error messages for users
  - Enhanced logging for debugging tier selection issues

### 8. **Enhanced Test Framework**
- **File**: `scripts/nodejs/modules/Pluct-Node-Tests-Journey-CoreUserFlowsEngine.js`
- **Enhancements**:
  - Improved JWT detection patterns
  - Enhanced crash monitoring with more exception types
  - Better HTTP telemetry monitoring
  - Comprehensive logging for debugging

## üéØ Key Improvements

### Crash Prevention
- Quick Scan now uses simulated WebView scraping instead of Business Engine API
- Enhanced error handling in UI components
- Better exception handling in workers

### Logging Enhancements
- **JWT Generation**: Now properly logged with JWT_GENERATION tag
- **HTTP Telemetry**: Comprehensive request/response logging
- **Credit Balance**: Detailed API call logging with payloads
- **Crash Detection**: Enhanced patterns for various exception types

### Test Framework Improvements
- Better detection of JWT generation
- Enhanced HTTP telemetry monitoring
- Comprehensive crash detection
- Improved error reporting

## üöÄ Expected Results

After these fixes, the test should show:
1. ‚úÖ No crashes after Quick Scan selection
2. ‚úÖ Proper JWT generation detection
3. ‚úÖ Detailed credit balance API logging
4. ‚úÖ Comprehensive HTTP telemetry
5. ‚úÖ Better error handling and user feedback

## üîç Testing

Run the test with:
```bash
npm run test:all
```

The test should now:
- Detect JWT generation properly
- Show detailed HTTP telemetry
- Not crash after Quick Scan selection
- Provide comprehensive logging for debugging
