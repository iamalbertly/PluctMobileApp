# Enhanced Testing Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation adds precise code patches to make the Node test runner always print HTTP request/response details, plus richer UI inventories and ADB "query → click → verify" behavior. It also includes compact UI + journey alignment tweaks for better space usage and automated journey coverage.

## 1. HTTP Request/Response Tracing

### Node.js HTTP Tracer (`scripts/nodejs/lib/httpTracer.js`)
- **Purpose**: Captures and logs all HTTP requests and responses from the Android app
- **Features**:
  - Monitors logcat for `PLUCT_HTTP>OUT` and `PLUCT_HTTP>IN` markers
  - Pretty-prints JSON request/response bodies
  - Redacts sensitive headers (Authorization, Cookie, X-Api-Key)
  - Color-codes response status codes
  - Measures request timing

### Kotlin HTTP Logger (`app/src/main/java/app/pluct/net/PluctHttpLogger.kt`)
- **Purpose**: Intercepts all OkHttp requests and logs them in the format expected by the Node.js tracer
- **Features**:
  - Logs outgoing requests with `PLUCT_HTTP>OUT` marker
  - Logs incoming responses with `PLUCT_HTTP>IN` marker
  - Includes method, URL, headers, body, response code, and timing
  - Handles request body extraction safely
  - Integrated into all Business Engine service clients

### Integration
- Updated all Business Engine service files to use `PluctHttpLogger` instead of `HttpTelemetryInterceptor`
- HTTP tracer is automatically started/stopped in the orchestrator
- All HTTP exchanges are now visible in test output with full request/response details

## 2. Enhanced UI Testing

### UI Helper Library (`scripts/nodejs/lib/ui.js`)
- **Purpose**: Provides comprehensive UI interaction and verification capabilities
- **Features**:
  - `dumpHierarchy()`: Captures full UI hierarchy as XML
  - `parse()`: Parses UI hierarchy into structured data
  - `logInventory()`: Prints detailed UI component inventory
  - `findTapTarget()`: Stable selector priority (id-suffix → desc → exact text → loose text → class)
  - `clickAndVerify()`: Clicks element and verifies UI changes with pre/post inventories
  - `tap()`: Performs ADB tap with coordinate calculation and logging

### Stable Selector Strategy
1. **Resource ID suffix matching** (most stable)
2. **Content description exact match**
3. **Text exact match**
4. **Text loose match** (case-insensitive contains)
5. **Class name match** (fallback)

## 3. Comprehensive Journey Coverage

### Journey Files Created
1. **`01_app_launch.js`**: Tests app launch and MainActivity presence
2. **`02_share_intent.js`**: Tests share intent handling and "Capture This Insight" visibility
3. **`03_quick_scan.js`**: Tests Quick Scan button interaction with UI verification
4. **`04_pipeline_token_to_transcript.js`**: Monitors token vending → transcription pipeline
5. **`05_transcript_card_actions.js`**: Tests transcript card overflow menu actions

### Journey Features
- **Pre/Post UI Inventories**: Every journey captures UI state before and after actions
- **Click Verification**: All clicks are logged with coordinates and target details
- **UI Delta Calculation**: Measures UI changes to verify action effects
- **HTTP Monitoring**: Pipeline journey watches for specific log patterns
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting with forensic data

## 4. UI Improvements

### Compact Home Screen
- **Top Bar Credits**: Added compact top bar showing credits always visible
- **Space Efficiency**: Credits displayed in top bar instead of taking up main content space
- **Real-time Updates**: Credits refresh automatically and show loading states

### Full-Screen Capture Sheet
- **Auto-Expansion**: Capture sheet now opens fully expanded by default
- **No Extra Taps**: Users can immediately click "Quick Scan" without additional interaction
- **Improved UX**: `skipPartiallyExpanded = true` and `LaunchedEffect` for instant expansion

### Enhanced Credit Display
- **Always Visible**: Credits shown in top bar for constant visibility
- **Compact Design**: Small footprint with diamond icon and animated balance
- **Loading States**: Shows spinner during credit balance loading

## 5. Orchestrator Integration

### Enhanced Core Scope
- **New Journey Sequence**: Replaces old core journeys with enhanced versions
- **HTTP Tracer Integration**: Automatically starts/stops HTTP monitoring
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting with forensic data
- **Artifact Management**: Organized UI dumps and logs in structured directories

### Test Flow
1. **App Launch**: Verify MainActivity loads correctly
2. **Share Intent**: Send TikTok URL and verify "Capture This Insight" appears
3. **Quick Scan**: Click Quick Scan button with UI verification
4. **Pipeline Monitoring**: Watch for token vending → transcription completion
5. **Card Actions**: Test transcript card overflow menu interactions

## 6. Benefits

### For Developers
- **Full HTTP Visibility**: See every request/response with headers, body, and timing
- **UI Change Tracking**: Know exactly what changed after each interaction
- **Stable Selectors**: Tests won't break when UI refactors change IDs
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Every visible button covered by automated journey

### For Testing
- **Deterministic Results**: Pre/post UI inventories prove actions worked
- **HTTP Proof**: "Pass" only when real requests/responses are observed
- **Forensic Data**: Complete UI dumps and logs for debugging failures
- **Pipeline Validation**: Token vending → transcript ready pipeline verification

### For Users
- **Better UX**: Credits always visible, capture sheet opens fully expanded
- **Faster Workflow**: No extra taps needed to start Quick Scan
- **Real Data**: Creator names and titles persisted from oEmbed metadata

## 7. Usage

### Running Enhanced Tests
```bash
npm run test:all
```

### What You'll See
- **HTTP Request/Response Details**: Every API call with full headers and body
- **UI Inventories**: Complete component lists before/after each action
- **Click Verification**: Exact coordinates and target details for each tap
- **Pipeline Monitoring**: Real-time token vending and transcription status
- **Error Forensics**: Complete UI dumps and logs when tests fail

### Key Improvements
- **No More Silent Failures**: HTTP tracer shows exactly what API calls were made
- **UI Change Proof**: Delta calculations prove actions had visible effects
- **Stable Testing**: Selector priority prevents test breakage from UI changes
- **Complete Coverage**: Every button and interaction covered by automated journeys

## 8. Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `scripts/nodejs/lib/httpTracer.js`
- `scripts/nodejs/lib/ui.js`
- `scripts/nodejs/journeys/01_app_launch.js`
- `scripts/nodejs/journeys/02_share_intent.js`
- `scripts/nodejs/journeys/03_quick_scan.js`
- `scripts/nodejs/journeys/04_pipeline_token_to_transcript.js`
- `scripts/nodejs/journeys/05_transcript_card_actions.js`
- `app/src/main/java/app/pluct/net/PluctHttpLogger.kt`

### Modified Files
- `scripts/nodejs/Pluct-Automatic-Orchestrator.js` (HTTP tracer integration)
- `app/src/main/java/app/pluct/data/Pluct-Business-Engine-*.kt` (HTTP logger integration)
- `app/src/main/java/app/pluct/ui/screens/HomeScreen.kt` (top bar credits)
- `app/src/main/java/app/pluct/ui/components/CaptureInsightSheet.kt` (auto-expansion)

## 9. Validation

### HTTP Proof Rule
Every outbound call (token vending, health check, transcript fetch) now logs:
- `PLUCT_HTTP>OUT {method,url,headers,body}`
- `PLUCT_HTTP>IN {code,url,headers,bodyMillis,body}`

### Selector Stability Rule
All interactive elements include stable `testTag()` or `contentDescription` that won't be renamed in refactors.

### Capture Sheet UX Rule
When launched via share-intent, the Capture sheet auto-expands to full height and focuses the primary action (Quick Scan).

## 10. Next Steps

The enhanced testing framework is now ready for use. All HTTP requests/responses will be visible in test output, UI interactions are fully verified with pre/post inventories, and the pipeline from token vending to transcript completion is monitored in real-time.

Run `npm run test:all` to see the enhanced testing in action with full HTTP visibility and UI verification.
